# Future Plans


1. Add accounts, ability to view another person's account and the public sets, add an image to represent you. The image (default can be google account image) should be in the top right

2. Add an ability to star others' sets (so they appear on your home screen) (each set should show num. users with it starred (should be 1 for the creator automatically))
The star button should go in the top left of the StartLearning page for that set, and be an icon filled in (yellow) when clicked (with total number of stars to the right), or gray when clicked again/unselected.
In the Home page the number of stars (it should also be togglable in this page, for example a user who has some)
If the set is on your home page and isn't yours it should also include the username of the creator below

3. Add a Search Function to let users explore the base of sets / revamp the unlogged in home view. Add a better sorting feature for sets (tie to textbook series, etc.)


Add a Learn Mode which mixes learning types

Make theming more original? (Night Market mode)

Add more personalized features which are specific to Chinese language learning (similarity based on radicals or something?)
