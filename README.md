# Future Plans

## Large Changes
UI Refresh! Make theming more original? (Night Market mode)
- imaging a toggle between card mode and another mode
- needs to support usage on ipad, iphone, and mac

3. Add a Search Function to let users explore the base of sets / revamp the unlogged in home view. Add a better sorting feature for sets (tie to textbook series, etc.) Including letting users create folders of vocab sets for better organization, this should involve a re-vamp of the home page

4. Add a Learn Mode which mixes learning types, update the learning algorithm to be more complex.

5. Plug in a real dictionary as the backend for this website (maybe https://www.plecoforums.com/threads/the-moe-dictionary-is-now-open-source.3606/ )
    - use this for definition suggestions
    - NOTE: The main thing stopping this from being a plug and play solution is words with multiple definitions.
    - also use for new in-context usage stuff
        - Auto generate a sentence for each vocab term or grammatical setup (how to do reliably)

6. Add more personalized features which are specific to Chinese language learning (similarity based on radicals or something?)
