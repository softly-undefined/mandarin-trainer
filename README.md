# Future Plans

## Large Changes
UI Refresh! Make theming more original? (Night Market mode)
- imaging a toggle between card mode and another mode
- needs to support usage on ipad, iphone, and mac

1. Add user accounts (they already exist, but add a "home page" individual to user that shows what public sets you have created), ability to view another person's account and their public sets, and add an image to represent you. The image (default can be google account image) should be in the top right of the page and double as the settings. In settings you should be able to change the picture. Add the ability to have private sets.

2. Add an ability to star others' sets (so they appear on your home screen) (each set should show num. users with it starred (should be 1 for the creator automatically))
- The star button should go in the top left of the StartLearning page for that set, and be an icon filled in (yellow) when clicked (with total number of stars to the right), or gray when clicked again/unselected.
- In the Home page the number of stars (it should also be togglable in this page, for example a user who has some)
- If the set is on your home page and isn't yours it should also include the username of the creator below

3. Add a Search Function to let users explore the base of sets / revamp the unlogged in home view. Add a better sorting feature for sets (tie to textbook series, etc.) Including letting users create folders of vocab sets for better organization, this should involve a re-vamp of the home page

4. Add a Learn Mode which mixes learning types, update the learning algorithm to be more complex.

5. Plug in a real dictionary as the backend for this website (maybe https://www.plecoforums.com/threads/the-moe-dictionary-is-now-open-source.3606/ )
    - use this for definition suggestions
    - NOTE: The main thing stopping this from being a plug and play solution is words with multiple definitions.
    - also use for new in-context usage stuff
        - Auto generate a sentence for each vocab term or grammatical setup (how to do reliably)

6. Add more personalized features which are specific to Chinese language learning (similarity based on radicals or something?)
